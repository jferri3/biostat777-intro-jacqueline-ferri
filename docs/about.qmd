Hello!

My name is Jacqueline Ferri! I am a second year PhD student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am originally from Massachusetts and moved to Maryland in 2022 to start working as a technician at Johns Hopkins before joining the Microbiology, Molecular Biology, and Immunology (MMI) PhD program in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public health.

I got my undergradaute degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a Bachelors of Science in Biology which a focus on cell and molecular biology, and a minor in microbiology. 

I worked in the biopharmaceutical field for 3 years, working on the immunology side of early drug discovery. I applied to graduate schools for PhD programs, but was not successful so I moved to Maryland to take a research technician job at Johns Hopkins in the Sears Lab, working under Dr. Shaikh. 

After 2 years I applied again, and was accepted into the MMI program at JH BSPH!! 

Some fun facts about me . . . 

- I play the piano, I have for about 20 years.

- I love to read, anything and everything but my favorites are fantasy. 

- I am a first degree black belt in tae kwon do!

- I have two dogs!
