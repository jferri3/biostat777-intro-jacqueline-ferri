[This analysis investigates the use and presence of swears across languages. Are there common trends? Which languages have the most or fewest words? How do the words vary in length and structure?]{style="color:purple;"}

## Research Question

How do swears vary across languages and categories, and which languages or regions have the most extensive word lists?

## Intended Audience

This analysis is aimed at anyone curious about language variation in swears.

## Data Source

Data were obtained from the [Liquidata “Bad Words” dataset on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/bad-words)[@noauthor_liquidatabad-words_2020].

See the data dictionary: [Data dictionary](data_dictionary.md)

::: callout-note
-   Contains lists of swears from ~30 languages.

-   Each record includes the word, language, category, and severity rating.

-   Useful for text moderation, NLP, or studying linguistic variation.

## Data Preparation

We start by loading packages and the dataset, then cleaning it to remove duplicates and missing values. Language codes are converted into readable names in the newly added column 'language_name' for clarity.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(SnowballC)
library(knitr)
library(purrr)
library(ggpubr)

#Load dataset
bad_words <- read_csv("bad_words.csv")

#Create lookup table for language names
lang_lookup <- tibble::tibble(
language_code = c("ar","cs","da","de","en","eo","es","fa","fi","fil",
"fr","fr-CA-u-sd-caqc","hi","hu","it","ja","kab","ko",
"nl","no","pl","pt","ro","ru","sv","th","tlh","tr","zh"),
language_name = c("Arabic","Czech","Danish","German","English","Esperanto",
"Spanish","Persian (Farsi)","Finnish","Filipino","French",
"French (Canada - Quebec)","Hindi","Hungarian","Italian",
"Japanese","Kabyle","Korean","Dutch","Norwegian","Polish",
"Portuguese","Romanian","Russian","Swedish","Thai","Klingon",
"Turkish","Chinese")
)

#Join language names
bad_words_named <- bad_words %>%
left_join(lang_lookup, by = "language_code")

#Remove duplicates and missing values
cleaned <- bad_words_named %>%
distinct() %>%
drop_na(language_code)
```

## Total Swears by Language

We first count the total number of words per language to see which languages have the largest collections. I am also interested in looking at some basic statistics; mean and standard deviation. 

```{r}
# Step 1: Prepare stats per language 
cleaned <- cleaned %>% mutate(word_length = nchar(bad_word))

language_stats <- cleaned %>%
  group_by(language_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_words = n(),               # total number of words
    mean_length = mean(word_length), # mean swear length
    sd_length = sd(word_length),     # SD of swear lengths
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: One-way ANOVA for mean swear length differences 
anova_result <- aov(word_length ~ language_name, data = cleaned)

# Tukey HSD for pairwise differences
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)

# Step 3: Bar plot with SD error bars
ggplot(language_stats, aes(x = reorder(language_name, total_words), y = total_words)) +
  geom_col(fill = "purple") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = total_words - sd_length, ymax = total_words + sd_length),
                width = 0.3, color = "black") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Number of Swears per Language with SD",
    x = "Language",
    y = "Number of Words"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**English and French have the most number of swears compared to all other languages by almost half.**

```{r}
# Step 4: Alternate way of visualizing swear length differences 
ggplot(cleaned, aes(x = reorder(language_name, word_length, FUN = median), y = word_length)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = language_name), outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Swear Length Distribution by Language",
    x = "Language",
    y = "Swear Length (Characters)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Average swear length varies across languages, significantly. Geogrpahical location might have an effect on swear length - Western European languages and some Middle Eastern languages have longer swears, while Asian languages seem to have shorter swears. **

## While swearing and vulgarity are not necessarily the same concept; there are connections
Here is a look at the prevalence of vulgarity in online communication — while not directly related to my research, it’s something I found interesting. This study by Schweinberger and Burridge [@schweinberger_vulgarity_2025] shows the prevalence of vulgar language in onlinecommunication in English-speaking regions. 


![_Obsenity Graph showing swears by language_](obsenitygraph.jpeg)


From my data, seen to the left, it can be observed that English and French have the most swears. This may be due to cultural factors, media influence, informal speech traditions, and global reach of these languages. Both languages, although English more so than French, are what I'll call socially accessible 

- Swearing and vulgar language are shaped by culture and the loosening of formality in language  
- Media, online forums, and more forms of social connection which extend cultural reach may be at the root of the increase in swears for these two languages.  
- Other cultural differences may be involved, such as traditions of informal speech and satire

## Languages with the most and last swears

We examine the 10 languages with the most and least swears to compare them side by side.

```{r}
words_per_language <- cleaned %>%
count(language_name, sort = TRUE)

top_languages <- words_per_language %>% slice_max(n, n=10) %>% mutate(group="Most")
bottom_languages <- words_per_language %>% slice_min(n, n=10) %>% mutate(group="Least")
combined <- bind_rows(top_languages, bottom_languages)

max_n <- max(combined$n)

ggplot(combined, aes(x = reorder(language_name, n), y = n, fill = group)) +
geom_col() +
coord_flip() +
facet_wrap(~group, scales = "free_y") +
scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, max_n)) +
scale_fill_manual(values=c("Most"="purple","Least"="pink")) +
labs(
title = "Comparison of Top and Bottom Languages by Number of bad Words",
x = "Language",
y = "Number of Words",
fill = "Group"
) +
theme_minimal()
```

## Longest Swear Per Language

I was interested in determining the longest word for each language. We look at the longest word for each language to explore the extremes in swear length. The swears will also be displayed in a table to see examples of swears across languages.


```{r}
top_words_per_lang <- cleaned %>%
group_by(language_name) %>%
slice_max(nchar(bad_word), n=1, with_ties=FALSE) %>%
ungroup() %>%
select(language_name, bad_word)

knitr::kable(top_words_per_lang, caption="Longest Swear Word Per Language")
```

## Swear Length Statistics

We calculate the shortest, longest, median, and mean lengths of words per language.

```{r}
cleaned <- cleaned %>% mutate(word_length = nchar(bad_word))

word_length_summary <- cleaned %>%
group_by(language_name) %>%
summarise(
shortest = min(word_length),
longest = max(word_length),
median_length = median(word_length),
mean_length = mean(word_length),
.groups = 'drop'
)

ggplot(word_length_summary, aes(x = reorder(language_name, longest))) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = language_name, y = shortest, yend = longest), color = "violet", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = longest), color = "purple", size = 3) +
  geom_point(aes(y = shortest), color = "pink", size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Shortest and Longest Swears per Language",
    x = "Language",
    y = "Swear Length (Characters)",
    caption = "Lollipop chart showing range of swear lengths per language"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**There is a wide range of length of swears across many languages - similar to what was seen earlier, the largest swear seems to vary by geographical location**

## Common Roots and Stems

Next, we explore recurring word roots to see which patterns appear most frequently. 

This analysis will determine stems and roots for all swears included in the dataset, then filter for stems >/= 3. 

WARNING: this section includes the root of many swears, only expand if you are okay with graphic language

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
```{r}
# Languages supported by SnowballC
supported_langs <- c("da", "nl", "en", "fi", "fr", "de", "hu", "it", "no", "pt", "ro", "ru", "es", "sv")

# Add a column for stemmed words, stemming when language is supported
bad_words_stemmed <- cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    stem = map2_chr(
      bad_word,
      language_code,
      ~ if (.y %in% supported_langs) {
          tryCatch(wordStem(.x, language = .y), error = function(e) substr(.x, 1, 4))
        } else {
          substr(.x, 1, 4)
        }
    ),
    root = substr(stem, 1, 4)
  )

# Summarize across *all* languages
root_summary <- bad_words_stemmed %>%
  group_by(language_name, stem) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(count > 2) %>%
  arrange(stem, desc(count))

# Display table
root_summary %>%
  select(language_name, stem, count) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Most Common Roots of Swears Across All Languages")
```

## Additional Analyses

Average Swear Length

```{r}
avg_length <- cleaned %>%
group_by(language_name) %>%
summarise(avg_length = mean(nchar(bad_word)), .groups="drop")

ggplot(avg_length, aes(x=reorder(language_name, avg_length), y=avg_length)) +
geom_col(fill="darkviolet") +
coord_flip() +
labs(title="Average Length of Swaer Words by Language", x="Language", y="Average Characters") +
theme_minimal()
```

**This analysis is dispalyed in alphabetical order of swear stems - it was interesting to see how many times different stems appear. Languages vary in regards to number of times a stem is used. **

## Range of Swear Lengths

```{r}
# Violin plot of swear lengths per language
ggplot(cleaned, aes(x = reorder(language_name, word_length, FUN = median), y = word_length)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "darkviolet", alpha = 0.7, color = "violet") +
  stat_summary(fun = median, geom = "point", shape = 23, size = 2, fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Swear Swear Lengths per Language",
    x = "Language",
    y = "Swear Length (Characters)",
    caption = "Median shown as yellow diamond"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Unique Roots Per Language

```{r}
bad_words_stemmed <- cleaned %>%
mutate(stem = wordStem(bad_word)) %>%
mutate(root = substr(bad_word, 1, 4)) # crude root approximation

unique_roots_all <- bad_words_stemmed %>%
group_by(language_name) %>%
summarise(unique_roots = n_distinct(stem), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(unique_roots_all, aes(x = reorder(language_name, unique_roots), y = unique_roots)) +
geom_col(fill = "darkviolet") +
coord_flip() +
labs(
title = "Number of Unique Roots per Language (All Languages Included)",
x = "Language",
y = "Number of Unique Roots"
) +
theme_minimal()
```

## Summary

Across the dataset, English and French have the largest number of swears, while some less widely spoken languages have far fewer entries. Swear length varies widely, with some languages having extremely long or short swears. Most languages have swears with only a handful of characters, but a few languages have exceedlingly long swears; English, Italian, Russian, Dutch, and Persian all have swears over 30 characters. My favorite part of the analysis was looking at the common stems for swears, even between languages there are some visual similarities between the stems.
