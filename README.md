## Author
Jacqueline Ferri

## Description
This project is a data analysis exploring the distribution, length, and structure of profane words across more than 30 languages. The analysis uses the [Liquidata “Bad Words” dataset on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/bad-words) and includes data wrangling, visualization, and linguistic analysis of word roots and stems. Visualizations include bar plots, violin plots, and faceted comparisons to summarize language-specific patterns.
