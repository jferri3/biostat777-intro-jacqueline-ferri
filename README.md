## Description
This public repository is where I am hosting my portfolio website which includes an example analysis of profane words from almost 30 languages.

The analysis uses the [Liquidata “Bad Words” dataset on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/bad-words) and includes data wrangling, visualization, and linguistic analysis of word roots and stems. Visualizations include bar plots, violin plots, and faceted comparisons to summarize language-specific patterns.

## Website Link
The deployed website can be accessed here: https://jferri3.github.io/biostat777-intro-jacqueline-ferri/

## Technical Details
- Created with **Quarto** (`.qmd` file).  
- Data wrangling performed with **dplyr** and **tidyr**.  
- Visualizations created using **ggplot2** with multiple `geom_*()` types including `geom_col()`, `geom_violin()`, and `geom_linerange()`.  
- Tables generated with **knitr**.  
- Callout blocks, margin content, and collapsible sections implemented using Quarto markdown extensions.  
- Bibliography managed through a `.bib` file with at least three references.

## Deployment
The website was rendered to HTML using Quarto. After rendering, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
